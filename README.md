# horiseon-seo-optimization
Refactor an existing codebase for a webpage to meet current accessibility standards

User Story
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

Purpose - 
This projects purpose is to take an existing code source and update it to newer HTML5 standards in terms of accessibility and readablity for future coders. 
To perform and update the codebase to these standards, I did some research online, such as W3Schools and even various youtube videos to develop a understanding of semantic HTML elements and how to replace existing elements in the code.
