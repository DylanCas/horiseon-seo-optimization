# horiseon-seo-optimization
## Purpose
- This projects purpose is to take an existing code source and update it to newer HTML5 standards in terms of accessibility and readablity for future coders. 
To perform and update the codebase to these standards, I did some research online, such as W3Schools and even various youtube videos to develop a understanding of semantic HTML elements and how to replace existing elements in the code.
